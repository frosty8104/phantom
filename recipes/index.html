                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>4 large eggs, yolks and whites separated</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup non-dairy milk</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
                        <li>/1/2 cup arrowroot powder</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
                        <li>1/8 tsp sea salt</li>
                        <li>3 tbsp butter or coconut oil</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 400F. Combine 4 yolks and salt and whisk until thick. Whisk in milk, water, and vanilla. Add in arrowroot and 
                    whisk until smooth. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Add the whites to the yolk mixture,
                    gently whisk until the whites are incorporated, but not deflated. Light foam is what you want. Melt 3 tbsp butter in a 10 inch 
                    oven safe skillet over medium heat. Once the bubbles have subsided, pour the batter into the skillet and cook until the bottom is
                    golden (about 2 minutes). Place the skillet in the oven and bake until it puffs up and the top is golden and feels dry and set 
                    (about 10-12 minutes). Slide onto a plate and serve with hot butter and syrup, fresh fruit sauce or warm preserves.</p>

                    <h2>Paleo Chicken Stuffing</h2>
                    <h4>(Source: paleofood.com)</h4>
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>2 cups finely ground blanched almonds (or almond meal)</li>
                        <li>1 cup chopped onion (use dried chopped onion for better flavour)</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup chopped celery</li><li>1 tsp ground sage</li>
                        <li>1 tsp ground thyme</li>
                        <li>chopped parsley</li>
                        <li>1 Tbsp mild-flavoured oil (more if it seems too dry)</li>
                        <li>pepper to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mix together all ingredients. Fill cavity of bird with mixture, then roast.</p>
                    <p>Note: I've found I prefer the stuffing cooked in a separate dish instead of in the bird. Also, we like to spice things up at my 
                    family's house, so we add, at the very least, cranberries and mushrooms to it.</p>
                    <h2>Slow Cooker Butter Chicken</h2>
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sizepieces</li>
                        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                        <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
                        <li>1 Tbsp curry paste</li>
                        <li>1 tsp tandoori masala</li>
                        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
                        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
                        <li>15 green cardamon pods</li>
                        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
                        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
                        <li>salt to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Melt the butter and vegatable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until
                    the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, curry paste, tandoori masala, garam masala,
                    and tomato paste until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Pour into a slow cooker, and stir in the cardamon pods, coconut milk, and 
                    yogurt. Season to taste with salt.</p>
                    <p>Cook on high 4 - 6 hours, or on low 6 - 8 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency.
                    Remove and discard the cardamon pods before serving. 6 servings</p>

                    <h2>Paleo Pie Crust</h2>
                    <h4>(Source: Wholesome Yum)</h4>
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>2 - 1/2 C almond flour</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp sea salt (1/2 tsp if savoury)</li>
                        <li>1/4 C ghee (measured solid, then melted)</li>
                        <li>1 large egg (or 2 Tbsp ghee)</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line the bottom of a 9" pan with parchment paper, or grease well.</p>
                    <p>2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour and salt.</p>
                    <p>3. Stir in the melted ghee and egg until well combined. (If using vanilla, stir that into the ghee before adding dry ingredients.)
                    The "dough" will be dry and crumbly. Just keep mixing, pressing, and stirring until it's uniform, and there's no almond flour powder
                    left. (Alternatively, you can use a food processor to mix it all together.)</p>
                    <p>4. Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. You can flute the edges if desired; if it crumbles while doing this, just
                    press it back together. Carefully poke holes in the surface using a fork to prevent bubbling.</p>
                    <p>5. Bake for 10 - 12 minutes until lightly golden brown. (Add fillings only after pre-baking.)</p>

                    <h4>(Source: Paleo Cupboard)</h4>
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature (variation: chia 'egg' - 1 Tbsp ground chia, 3 Tbsp water)</li>
                        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                        <li>1 - 1/2 almond flour</li>
                        <li>1/4 C tapioca flour</li>
                        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp basil</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Place the eggs and oil in a small mixing bowl and stir until well combined. Set aside.</p>
                    <p>2. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a medium size mixing bowl and stir with a fork to break apart clumps and to combine well.
                    Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir well until combined. Set aside for about 5 - 10 minutes and then split in half and
                    form into two round balls.</p>
                    <p>3. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake crust for 15 minutes or until firm.</p>

                        <li>Heat water to 105 - 110 degrees F. Add honey or maple syrup and stir. Add the yeast and let it stand 10 minutes. The 
                        yeast should bubble or foam - if it doesn't - start over.</li>
                        <li>Whisk the psyllium powder into the yeast mixture to fully combine (no lumps!). Let stand 1 minute to thicken. Whisk in
                        the melted shortening.</li>
                        <li>Pour the thickened yeast-psyllium mixture into the dry ingredients and mix well with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula
                        to form a sticky dough.</li>
                        <li>Cover with a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm spot to rise for one hour or until doubled in size.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment or by lightly greasing.</li>
                        <li>Punch dough down and knead for one minute. Divide dough into 8 balls and place on prepared pan. Using wet hands, smooth
                        the top of the dough. You may use a serrated knife to cut an "X" or tic-tac-toe pattern on the top to allow fot the bread to
                        expand. Brush with egg wash, if using. Place in a warm spot to let rise for another 30 minutes until the oven preheats.</li>

                    golden brown.</p>
                    <p>3. Add the beef and chicken broth, and bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk. Stir in the starch and simmer for 3 - 5 minutes or
